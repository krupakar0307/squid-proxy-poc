# squid-proxy-poc
this is just a workaround about squid-proxy, how it secures and allows the incoming traffic from only specified URLs. this is local setup. Moving forward wanna setup in private environemtns and every traffic should flow from this proxy thats we can have logs about incoming traffic and restrict the flow of network tightly,
